    "Description": "I discovered that the registered delegates for a given message are invoked in the reverse order of registration.  In my application, I needed to ensure some specific delegates were invoked before all the others.  I added following 1 line (and comment) to MessageToActionsMap.GetActions(...) right before the final \"return actions;\"\n        // Because it *may* be important to preserve the order of the original weakActions List\n        // and weakActions was traversed in reverse order, reverse the final list.\n        actions.Reverse();",
