    "Description": "A minor defect, but one that irks the test-infected :\nThe test method ObservableObjectTest.InvalidPropertyNameIsReported fails in the Release build : indeed it is testing a feature that is documented as belonging only in Debug builds !\nThat method should thus probably be surrounded with #if(DEBUG)/#endif or tagged with some equivalent attribute.\nÂ \nI'll finish by hijacking this issue ticket to say thanks a lot for sharing all the good stuff on WPF for all this time ! :)",
