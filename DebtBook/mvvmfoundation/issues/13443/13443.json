    "Description": "Hello all,\nI don't know if I am right in the MVVM Foundation project with my question. If not let me know, please.\n\nI want to develop a Windows 8.1 Store app. I have a list with several list items and a gauge view. As well the list as the gauge has its own view model. Change the selection in the list must cause a change in the gauge model.\n\nI have no idea how to realize these dependencies between the models. I have googled for a long time but the satisfied solution I could not find. Can anyone help?\n\nBest regards\ngpunkt2016",
