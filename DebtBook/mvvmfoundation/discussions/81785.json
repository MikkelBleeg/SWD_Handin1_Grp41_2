I have lately developed many unreleased behaviors/actions/triggers that are perfect for use together with MVVM, but it would be even better if I could bundle these with a basic MVVM project that includes the messenger and relaycommand for example. Would this be ok as long as I include the same license as you do? I would also like to add a good basic dialog box support in this project, which I currently feel is missing in MVVM foundation.</p>\r\n<p>Keep up the good work! /Johan</p>",
