Effectively the tests for expected exceptions don't work because the Debugger intercepts them before the unit test can deal with them.</p>\r\n<p>The issue is discussed <a title=\"Debugger, unit tests and exceptions\" href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/vsdebug/thread/25bdf149-5133-4f47-bbf2-1d4ca638fee9\">here</a>&nbsp;and has some wider implications.</p>\r\n<p>Just thought it might help others scratching their head when they get errors during the unit tests in VS2010 like:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">&quot;Must pass a parameter of type System.String with this message. Registered action(s) expect it.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Scott</p>",
